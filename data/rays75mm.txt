rays75mm.mat

Contains ray data collected in Zemax.
'rays' - 	1000 x 4 x 3 matrix
			The columns contian x, y, theta_x, theta_y where the angles are measured along the positive z-axis (into the image plane)
			The rows are 1000 different rays from an axial point through a random position in the pupil plane
			The third dimension is the wavelength with the following wavelengths in this order:
			0.45, 0.55, 0.65 um
