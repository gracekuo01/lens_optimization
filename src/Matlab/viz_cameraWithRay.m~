%   Display camera with default ray drawn. Default,

%   Inputs:
%       camera - array of structures with fields (R, n, d, sd). Each
%           element of array represents a surface
%       x0, y0, xt, yt - initial positions and angle of rays. These can
%           either be scalars or vectors of the same length (for multiple
%           rays)
%       fwdstr - either 'fwd' or 'bwd' to trace ray forward or backwards.
%           * 'fwd' means the intial positions are on the object plane and
%              the intial angles are pointed from the object plane to the
%              sensor plane
%           * 'bwd' means the intial positions are on the sensor plane and
%              the intial angles are pointed from the sensor plane to the
%              object plane
%       h - (optional) handle of axes to plot in
